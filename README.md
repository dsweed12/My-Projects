1. I got a piece of text in Hebrew but unfortunately it was written in inverted way - each word was written from left to right in respect to its charchters.
So I wrote a program that reverses the text and prints it properly.
2. Python extensive course
I attached here my solved problemsets (some of are inside the folder 'venv' - I need to reorganize here)
